This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a remote image URL that is temporarily unavailable or has a slow response time.  The image might fail to load, leaving a blank space or a broken image icon, but without any clear error message in the console. This can be particularly problematic because it's difficult to debug due to the lack of explicit error handling within Expo's Image component.
